Yahtzee rules
=============

The game of yahtzee is a simple dice game. Each player
rolls five six-sided dice. They can re-roll some or all
of the dice up to three times (including the original roll).

For example, suppose a players rolls
    3,4,5,5,2
They hold (-,-,5,5,-) and re-roll (3,4,-,-,2)
    5,1,5,5,3
They hold (5,-,5,5,-) and re-roll (-,1,-,-,3)
    5,6,5,5,2

The player then places the roll in a category, such as ones,
twos, fives, pair, two pairs etc (see below). If the roll is
compatible with the category, the player gets a score for the
roll according to the rules. If the roll is not compatible
with the category, the player scores zero for the roll.

For example, suppose a player scores 5,6,5,5,2 in the fives
category they would score 15 (three fives). The score for
that go is then added to their total and the category cannot
be used again in the remaining goes for that game. 
A full game consists of one go for each category. Thus, for
their last go in a game, a player must choose their only
remaining category.

Your task is to score a GIVEN roll in a GIVEN category.
You do NOT have to program the random dice rolling.
The game is NOT played by letting the computer choose the
highest scoring category for a given roll.
